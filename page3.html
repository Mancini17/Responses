<section> 
<p>After watching the video "Lo and Behold" with Ted Nelson in Herzog's, i felt on his level and understood what he was explaining. At the beginning, Ted was talking about one of his moments when he was younger, when he put his hand under water. He focused on how the water wrapped his hand so quickly and related the situation to interconnection with the web and the user. I love this analogy because the user and the web should have a joint relationship and everything must flow nicely and efficiently. Ted mentioned how in today's world, there is no good cut and paste tools and in today's computers they changed the meaning of cut and paste and pretended that it was the same thing. With his computer work, he focuses on expressing, representing, and showing interconnection in writings. Ted later went on his computer and showed an example of his interconnection/links through words. He brought up Bible passages and links to what reading they belong to. I found his example of links very easy to understand and to navagate through. The interface he was working with was in an aerial view and you just have to scroll right and left to view the other pages. His example seems much more user friendly, and i wish i could be using his interface to better my work. Overall i found Ted Nelson's interview to be very knowledgable for me. I enjoyed hearing his view on interconnection and seeing his examples because they truly opened my eyes that there can be other interfaces out there, than the mainstream ones we have today. </p>
