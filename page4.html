<section> 
<p>Reading "The Web Designer Exposing the Humanity and Humor of the Internet", i began to see the web differently and started to appreciate humor in the web way more than i use to. This article by Charmaine Li was an interesting one, as it was filled with different parts of Jon Lucas's life. Jon Lucas is a web designer based in New York, who likes to utilize the aspect of humor into his work, "You have to have a sense of humor to live with the web". The thought of having humor in web design is brilliant. In my opinion, humor keeps the viewers interested, and curious/excited for more. Humor is something i may attempt in my future designs. Jon Lucas likes to make his websites with 3D artwork or motion graphics. Lucas does this to avoid "overly polished" websites. I love the idea of 3D artwork, especially within web design. It brings a totally different aspect to the viewer, as it creates depth within the web. In the future i hope to possess some 3D web design skills. I found it fascinating that Jon Lucas started making websites in college as a hobby. He then made a simple website for himself, as a friend noticed and asked for one, and then another friend asked, and the chain reaction happened. Within the article, Lucas mentioned "I'll see an element on a website and i can tell a human made that decision". I dont entirely agree with what Lucas said here. I cannot see the difference yet, however, Jon Lucas has more experience and has a different vision than me, and hopefully i will aquire a stronger vision for aspects of the web in my time here at Niagara College.</p>
