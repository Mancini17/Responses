<section> 
<p>The Crystal Goblet by Beatrice Warde is an opinion piece on book typography and how typography should be used and/or how typographers or designers should perceive and use types. In the article, she brought out some opinions about typography; good typography is modernist, and good typography is invisible as type. There were some opinions of hers such as labelling fine arts as removing its economic and education purpose. I agree with her in terms of her opinions on the science of typography to a large extent.</p>

<p>In her article, she mentioned that typography should not be viewed as fine arts as it removed the economic and educational purpose of the subject. She reiterated this point by saying it is mischievous to call any printed piece a work of art, especially fine art because that would imply that its first purpose was to exist as an expression of beauty for its own sake and for delectation of senses. In my opinion, this is a false accusation about the notion of fine arts. In todays world where technology is advanced, the role of fine art has evolved. Fine art has been defined as a visual art considered to have been created primarily for aesthetic and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture. Although one may argue that it is created primarily for aesthetics, it has been pervaded with intellectual purpose as it progressed through time. It is not correct to deem typography as lacking of economic and educational purpose when viewed as a fine art.</p>

<p>Apart from that, she also mentioned that good type is invisible as type. The author meant that when typography is used correctly or done correctly, it becomes natural to the eye instead of it being viewed as a mechanism. This is true because a good visual design shows a good blend of type and graphic. This meant that the composition of the type itself, or the design of the type blends in well with any graphic design, making it a successful design. This is because when the type has a big flaw, you cannot unsee it, and would pick on its technical design problem of the type, as it becomes visible to the crowd. In this way, good type would not be seen as a type but instead, viewed as an art.</p>

<p>Overall I agree that good typography is modernist . In her article, she meant that good typography follows the idea of form follows function and in todays context, typography can also be used in branding and conveying a message in print. The choice of the type is crucial because it sets the tone for the message, as it's functionality is important.</p>
